ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emily
<h2>About me</h2>

My first interest with coding started with video games when I played PokÃ©mon diamond with my cousin. This is the start of my interest in coding and my exploration in project creation. My main project is desktop widgets, due to the widgets I find online arenâ€™t very customizable or easy to use.
